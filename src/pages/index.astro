			<h2>Status</h2>
			<p>
				We are looking for a few more to join the group! The server was recently launched in December 2024 with the Pale Garden update. Only a few players are active and progressing at a modest pace. Very little of the world has been explored.
			</p>
			<Image src={hubImg} alt="" width={500} />
			<p>
				News will be posted to the private Discord along with monthly updates here.

			<h2>Blog</h2>
			<p>Our latest blog post is available here:</p>
			<PostCallout id={items[0].slug} />
			<p>At the end of each month, I will be posting a recap blog and showcase of our ongoing survival and building efforts.</p>

			<h2>About Turtlemay</h2>
			<p>30M delivery driver with several hobbies.</p>
			<p>
				My Minecraft play style is cozy neighborhood builder. I like bringing home interesting materials and improving my tiny houses and farms.
			</p>
			<Image src={turtlemayImg} alt="" width={500} />
			<p>
				My Minecraft knowledge mostly covers early beta through the "Combat Update" (2016), after which I stopped playing for many years. I've picked up again at the Pale Garden update and am learning about the new features as I go.
			</p>
			<p>I have lots of experience with servers.</p>
			<p>
				You can learn more about me at my
				<a href="https://www.turtlemay.us/">personal site</a>.

			<h2>Who should join?</h2>
			<p>
				You should join if you're an adult looking for some light co-op a few times a week or so. You must be older than 21, LGBTQ+ friendly, and preferably near the eastern United States. Any experience level is fine.
			</p>
			<p>
				Other than adding you to the group, I will not be acting as moderator or dungeon master. I am looking for friends and equals for a casual small community experience.
			</p>
			<p>
				Voice chat is not a priority but I would like to do some occasional group events.

			<h2>Technical Details</h2>
			<p>
				We are hosted on a dedicated home server with quad-core 3.6GHz, 16GB RAM, SSD, and 10Mbps upload, located in Ohio, using the latest Paper server software with minimal plugins besides MultiVerse and some creative tools.
			</p>
			<StatusWidget client:load initialData={statusWidgetData} />
			<p>
				Test your ping with
				<samp>ping mc.trtl.in</samp>.
				You want less than 100ms on average or you might have a bad time.
			</p>
			<p>
				I take regular backups of the server myself, but for your peace of mind, the latest package is also available
				<a href="http://mc.trtl.in/backup/mc.trtl.in_latest.tar.gpg">here</a>.
				It is GPG-encrypted with a password to be released only in the event of the server being retired. This ensures the integrity of our survival maps.
			</p>
			<p>
				See
				<a href="https://stats.uptimerobot.com/Pdac3JqB3G">UptimeRobot</a>
				for server status and uptime history.
