### New Member and Neighborhood Development
This month we've welcomed a new member to the community
and built several additions to the neighborhood,
including a developing bay area.
We've also recently begun exploring the world in search of new
resources and building materials.

A swamp villager was cured and housed in town.

### Boat/Fishing Dock
A dock was built on the coast of our yet-unnamed village
to support fishing and better facilitate migration from
the landing settlement into town.

### New Resources & Exploration
Four pale oak saplings were obtained from a wandering trader,
introducing a sustained source of pale wood to the world.

Our first expedition also yielded several more renewable resources
such as cherry trees, dark oak trees, and berry bushes.

During the expedition, a temporary camp and outpost
with a watchtower was established.

### Municipality & Uptown Development
Our original disembarkation site is commemorated as *Birke's Landing*,
with a guidepost denoting the nearby landing settlement, *Cape Birke*.
![](./images/landing_2025-02-24_22.31.39.png "Commemoration of our original landing site.")

The town of *Pepperton* has been established around the old village,
and a border erected between it and the developing uptown district.
![](./images/pepperton_2025-02-24_21.53.11.png)

A mountain pass was built between the landing settlement
and the bay area which houses the main skeleton farm.
Some primitive roads have also been drawn out between
the old neighborhood, developing town, and bay islands.
![](./images/road_2025-02-26_20.04.57.png "A signpost at a crossroad near the mountain pass.")

An alchemy lab was built uptown, largely to support zombie curing.
A small storage shed has also been erected to help stage more new builds.

### Bay Area Development

The island surrounding the skeleton farm has been
established as part of the *Ossuary Bay* area.

### More New Resources
A population of turtles has been established in the town creek
with eggs obtained from the bay area.

A few armadillos have been temporarily wrangled on the plateau near the bay island.

Other new resources available in town include cats, bees,
cocoa plants, bamboo, mangrove trees, and a sniffer.

### Engagement & Growth
![](./images/2025-02-05_22.52.57.png)

Our focus thus far has been local community development, slowly
gaining new resources through wandering traders, mining, and
some short expeditions. A major priority going forward will be
inviting more members to the group to maintain some
forward momentum going into our third month!
