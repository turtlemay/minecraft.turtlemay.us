This month we have welcomed a new member to the group and made some minor additions to the neighborhood.

### Turtle Grove Conservatory
A plant conservatory was constructed on the outskirts of Pepperton,
envisioned as a center for botanical research.
It overlooks the town from the hilltop.

### Road to Rhoeas
A dirt road was drawn out between Turtle Grove and the fortified village of Rhoeas for smoother travel
as well as creating an avenue for future neighborhood expansion.
